# This script takes a device name, looks up the partition label and
# type, creates /media/LABEL and mounts the partition.  Mount options

# If there's a problem at boot-time, this is where we'd put
# some test to check that we're booting, and then run
#     sleep 60
# so the system is ready for the mount below.
#
# An example to experiment with:
# Assume the system is "booted enough" if the HTTPD server is running.
# If it isn't, sleep for half a minute before checking again.
#
# The risk: if the server fails for some reason, this mount script
# will just keep waiting for it to show up.  A better solution would
# be to check for some file that exists after the boot process is complete.

# are owned by a std user instead of by root.  Change to your user's UID

#      mount -t auto -o uid=1000,gid=1000 [...]
